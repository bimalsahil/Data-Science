# Data Science Course Projects and Assignments

This repository contains the projects and assignments that I will be learning in my Data Science course. Each folder in this repository represents a project or assignment, with its own README file describing the purpose and contents of the project.

## About the Course

The Data Science course is designed to introduce learners to the core concepts and tools used in data science. 

Throughout the course, I will learn how to use Python programming language, data manipulation and analysis libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## How to Use This Repository

Each project or assignment folder contains its own README file, which provides a description of the project or assignment and how to run it. 

The code and data for the project or assignment can be found in the folder as well.

Feel free to explore the code and data and use them to further your own learning. I hope that this repository serves as a helpful resource for those interested in learning data science.

If you notice any errors or issues with the code or data in this repository, please don't hesitate to submit an issue or pull request. I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Thank You.
