    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as errors in program logic, invalid input, or issues with system resources. Examples of common exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, and ZeroDivisionError.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur when we write code that violates the syntax rules of the Python language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed. Syntax errors indicate that there is a mistake in the structure or syntax of your code, such as missing colons, parentheses, or incorrect indentation."
